# Overview

The web page consists of several distinct sections:

1. **Header**: 
   - Positioned at the top of the page.
   - Contains a logo on the left and navigation links on the right ("Home", "Maps", "About", "Contact").
   - The "Maps" link has a dropdown indicator.

2. **Main Banner**:
   - Below the header.
   - Features a large title: "Global Surgical and Anesthesia Workforce Mapping Project".
   - A subtitle: "Visualizing the world's perioperative workforce".
   - A world map graphic is displayed prominently.

3. **Mission Statement**:
   - Positioned below the main banner.
   - Contains a heading: "Our Mission".
   - A paragraph detailing the mission statement.

### Layout Considerations

- **Header**: 
  - Flexbox can be used to align the logo and navigation links horizontally.
  - The navigation links can be styled as a list with inline display.

- **Main Banner**:
  - Center the title, subtitle, and map graphic using flexbox or grid.
  - Ensure the background color spans the full width of the section.

- **Mission Statement**:
  - Use a container to center the content.
  - Apply padding and margin to ensure proper spacing.

### Recommendations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: 
  - Flexbox is recommended for the header and navigation links due to its simplicity in handling horizontal alignment.
  - Grid can be used for the main banner and mission statement for more complex layouts and better control over spacing.
